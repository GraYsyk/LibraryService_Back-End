# Library Service
Not a complex site created by me to strengthen the level of web application creation.

### People list
- We are greeted by a minimalistic menu to view all registered library customers.
 In the upper left corner is a logo which, when clicked on, will take you back to the home page. There is also a button on the site which, when clicked on, takes you to the form of adding a new user.

- If you click on the name of one of the clients, we get to the page of viewing information about him, where you can see all his contact information, there are only two fields,
   but there can be more, but it is not necessary for now. Also we can see the list of all books that the user took, by clicking on the button “Cancel book” the book will become free and someone else can take it.

# BACK-END

In general, concerning the server part of the project everything was quite simple, in the project files you will find the file **databaseproperties.origin** that will show you how to correctly set the values for connecting to the database.

Each class tried to clean and complete as much as possible. There are also comments that explain the functionality of each method.

That's all! I will be glad to any feedback from your side, thank you for your time!
